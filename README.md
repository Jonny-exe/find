# find


## Plan

Make a [meta search engine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metasearch_engine) that makes hits to [duckduckgo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metasearch_engine) with certain parameters to exclude web pages you want to ignore

You can then import a file with those web pages you don't want to see,
for example news pages you don't care about or "wikihow" results.
This way you get a better search experience with more accurate results based on your preference.

## How to use it

Add the list of web pages you'd like to ignore to into the ignore text field and you are good to go.


Example of sites I'd like to ignore:
```
wikihow.com facebook.com
```
